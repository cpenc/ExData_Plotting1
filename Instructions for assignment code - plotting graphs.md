# Intructions

1. Download the raw data file for this assignment from: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip
2. Set working directory as the directory which contains the raw data (household_power_consumption.txt file). If the working directory is not set correctly these programs will not work as expected!
3. Copy or download all the 5 R code files to the working directory.
4. The 5 files are:
    * exact_data_for_1st_and_2nd_feb_2007.R   #This code is used to extract assignment data from the raw data file
    * plot1.R                                 #Code to plot graph 1
    * plot2.R                                 #Code to plot graph 2
    * plot3.R                                 #Code to plot graph 3
    * plot4.R                                 #Code to plot graph 4
5. To run the code and generate graphs for the assignment, run the below commands
    * source("exact_data_for_1st_and_2nd_feb_2007.R")
    * source("plot1.R")
    * source("plot2.R")
    * source("plot3.R")
    * source("plot4.R")
6. All the graphs will be genereated in the current working directory
